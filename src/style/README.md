# CIDACS rmarkdown beamer template

This template keeps the folder structure required in [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) and my personal [template](https://github.com/lf-araujo/cidacs). It basically consists of three files within the /style folder: body_page.png, title.png and template.tex.

The `/src/2020-reuniao.Rmd` includes a meaningful yaml header.
